/*What is abstract class?
1. a class that contains abstract method is called abstract class.
2. What is an abstract method? -> a method that has just the method definition but does not contain implementation
3. an abstract can not be instantiated
4. since abstract can only be extended
5. abstract method can have normal method
6. if a normal class extend an abstract class, it has to overwrite all abstract method
7. the point of using abstract class is to extend it
8. if an abstract class b extends a, b do not need to overwrite a's abstract method
9. combine with 8, if a normal class c extend b, c has to overwrite both abstract methods from a and b
10.
